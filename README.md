# Improvment of Frozen Background Reference (FBR) Image for Monitoring Inshore Moving Targets
## Abstract

 Despite of exsist of harbor monitoring systems (e. g., vessel trafic control radar, communication systems, Automatic Identification System) the accidents are increasing every year. So, for the purpose of monitoring vessels, the studies of ship detection in near shore and inshore ares is being conducted.
